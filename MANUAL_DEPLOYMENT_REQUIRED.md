# MANUAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED - GIT BLOCKED

## Git Operations Completely Blocked

Replit has completely blocked all git operations to protect the repository. This is normal and expected in shared environments.

## SOLUTION: Manual File Transfer

Your professional service icons are ready and verified. Here's how to deploy them:

### Step 1: Access Your Deployment Files
Open these files in Replit and copy their content:

1. **Main Website File**: `deploy/index.html`
2. **JavaScript with Icons**: `deploy/assets/index-xJB_Go3f.js` 
3. **CSS Styling**: `deploy/assets/index-CMDr7sgo.css`
4. **Routing File**: `deploy/_redirects`
5. **Error Page**: `deploy/404.html`

### Step 2: Manual GitHub Upload
1. Go to: https://github.com/rizzhire/rizzhire.github.io
2. For each file above:
   - Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file" (or edit existing)
   - Copy the file name exactly (e.g., `assets/index-xJB_Go3f.js`)
   - Copy the entire content from Replit
   - Paste into GitHub
   - Commit with message: "Deploy professional service icons"

### Step 3: Verify Icons
After uploading all files:
- GitHub Pages will auto-deploy in 5-10 minutes
- Your website will show:
  - **Users** icon for Manpower Supply Services
  - **TrendingUp** icon for Management Consultancy Services
  - **UserCheck** icon for Recruitment Consultancy Services

## Why This Works
- Bypasses all git restrictions in Replit
- Uses GitHub's web interface (always available)
- Direct file upload triggers automatic deployment
- No command line operations needed

## Files Verified and Ready
All your professional service icons are confirmed in the deployment files and ready for manual transfer.
