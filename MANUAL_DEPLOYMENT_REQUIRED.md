# Manual Deployment Required

## Current Status
The styling fixes are completed and committed locally, but need to be pushed to GitHub to trigger the live site update.

## Issue
Git authentication is blocked in this environment, preventing automatic push to GitHub.

## What You Need To Do

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual File Upload
If git doesn't work, upload these modified files via GitHub web interface:

**Modified Files:**
1. `client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx` - Removed navbar border
2. `client/src/App.tsx` - Updated container styling  
3. `client/src/index.css` - Added smooth curve CSS

## Expected Result
After pushing, GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Build the updated site
2. Deploy to https://rizzhire.github.io/
3. Apply the seamless navbar and smooth curve fixes

## The Changes Made
- Removed visible partition line between navbar and container
- Improved border radius curve smoothness
- Added hardware acceleration for better rendering

Your live site will update within 2-5 minutes after pushing.
