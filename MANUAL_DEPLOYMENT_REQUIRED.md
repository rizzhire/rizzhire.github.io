## STATUS: âœ… BUILD VERIFIED - NEW ICONS CONFIRMED

The deployment script successfully verified your new professional service icons:
- **Users** icon for Manpower Supply Services

## DEPLOYMENT FILES READY:
- `deploy/` directory contains verified build with timestamp
- All icons confirmed in `index-xJB_Go3f.js`
- Fresh build completed: Aug 3 06:24

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:

Since Git operations are restricted in Replit, you need to manually:

### 1. Download Deployment Files
- Download the entire `deploy/` folder from Replit
- Or copy the contents of `deploy/` to your local machine

### 2. Upload to GitHub
- Replace the contents of your GitHub repository with these files
- Or create a new commit with the deploy/ contents

### 3. Trigger GitHub Pages
- Go to GitHub Actions â†’ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Click "Run workflow" manually

## ALTERNATIVE: Direct File Upload
You can also directly upload the files from the `deploy/` folder to your GitHub repository's main branch, which will automatically trigger the deployment.

The new icons are verified and ready - this is just a final file transfer step!
