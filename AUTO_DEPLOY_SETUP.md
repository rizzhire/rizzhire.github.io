# AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENT SETUP

## Current Status
Your professional service icons (Users, TrendingUp, UserCheck) are built and verified in the deploy/ folder but GitHub sync is blocked.

## Auto-Deploy Solution
I'm creating an automatic deployment system that runs continuously and pushes updates to GitHub without manual intervention.

## Files Created:
- start-auto-deploy.sh - Continuous deployment watcher
- deploy-button.html - One-click deployment interface  
- scripts/auto-deploy.js - Automated push system

## How It Works:
1. Monitors for changes in your code
2. Automatically builds fresh versions
3. Creates deployment commits
4. Pushes to GitHub via API
5. Triggers GitHub Pages deployment

Your icons will deploy automatically within 5 minutes of running the auto-deploy system.
