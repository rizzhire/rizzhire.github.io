# Immediate Deployment Solution

## The Reality
Replit's environment blocks git operations for security, so automatic deployment isn't possible through traditional git commands.

## Direct Solution - GitHub Web Interface

### Step 1: Edit the Main File
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/rizzhire/rizzhire.github.io/edit/main/client/src/App.tsx
2. **Find line 28-30** (the main tag that currently looks like):
   ```jsx
   <main className="bg-cream rounded-t-[2rem] relative z-10 min-h-screen overflow-hidden mt-16 content-reveal">
   ```
3. **Replace with**:
   ```jsx
   <main className="bg-cream rounded-t-smooth seamless-container relative z-10 min-h-screen overflow-hidden mt-16 content-reveal">
   ```

### Step 2: Commit
- Scroll down to "Commit changes"
- Add message: "Fix navbar partition line and smooth curves"
- Click "Commit changes"

## Alternative: Use Replit's Deploy Feature
1. Look for a "Deploy" button in your Replit interface
2. This may trigger the GitHub Pages deployment directly

## What This Will Fix
- Removes the visible partition line you see in the screenshot
- Applies smooth 60px curved borders instead of sharp edges  
- Activates hardware acceleration for better performance

## Expected Timeline
- GitHub Actions: 2-3 minutes to build
- Live site update: 3-5 minutes total at https://rizzhire.github.io/

The CSS classes are already in your codebase - this one line change will activate the seamless styling.
