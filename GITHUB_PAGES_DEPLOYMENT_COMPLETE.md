# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Status
Your styling changes are committed locally but need to be pushed to GitHub to update the live site.

## The Issue
Replit is showing "Unknown Git Error" which is preventing the push to GitHub.

## Solution: Manual Push Required

Since Replit's Git interface is having issues, you'll need to push the changes manually:

### From Your Local Computer:
1. **Clone or pull the repo locally:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rizzhire/rizzhire.github.io.git
   # OR if you already have it locally:
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Copy the modified files from Replit to your local repo:**
   - `client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx`
   - `client/src/App.tsx`
   - `client/src/index.css`

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix navbar partition line and smooth border curves"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Alternative: Direct File Edit on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/rizzhire/rizzhire.github.io
2. Navigate to each file and click "Edit"
3. Copy the content from the Replit files
4. Commit changes directly on GitHub

## What Changes Will Be Applied
✅ **Navbar Fix**: Removed the visible partition line between navbar and container
✅ **Smooth Curves**: Improved border radius with hardware acceleration
✅ **Professional Styling**: Seamless transitions for premium appearance

## Expected Timeline
- **GitHub Actions Build**: 2-3 minutes
- **Live Site Update**: 5 minutes after push
- **URL**: https://rizzhire.github.io/

The changes are ready and tested - they just need to reach GitHub to go live!
