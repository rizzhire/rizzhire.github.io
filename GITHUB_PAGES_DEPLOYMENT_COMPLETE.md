# GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## No Download Required - Copy Method

Since download isn't available, I've created multiple ways to get your deployment files:

## METHOD 1: Copy from deployment-package.txt
1. Open the `deployment-package.txt` file in Replit
2. Copy each section marked with "=== FILE: filename ==="
3. Create corresponding files in your GitHub repository
4. Paste the content and commit

## METHOD 2: Individual File Viewing
Your deployment files are ready in these locations:
- `deploy/index.html` - Main website file
- `deploy/assets/index-xJB_Go3f.js` - Contains your professional service icons
- `deploy/assets/index-CMDr7sgo.css` - Styling
- `deploy/_redirects` - Routing file
- `deploy/404.html` - Error page

## METHOD 3: Copy from file-copies/ folder
All files are duplicated in `file-copies/` for easy access.

## DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

### Step 1: Access GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com/rizzhire/rizzhire.github.io

### Step 2: Create/Replace Files
For each file in the deploy folder:
1. Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file" (or edit existing)
2. Name the file (e.g., index.html, assets/index-xJB_Go3f.js)
3. Copy content from Replit files
4. Commit each file

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
After committing all files:
- GitHub Pages will auto-deploy in 5-10 minutes
- Check your website for the new professional service icons

## YOUR ICONS ARE READY:
- Users icon for Manpower Supply Services
- TrendingUp icon for Management Consultancy Services
- UserCheck icon for Recruitment Consultancy Services

No download needed - everything can be copied directly from Replit files to GitHub.
