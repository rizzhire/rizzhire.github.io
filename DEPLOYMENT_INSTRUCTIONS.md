# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## üö® URGENT: Config File Issue Detected
There's a syntax error in vite.config.ts preventing builds. Here's the immediate fix:

## Quick Fix Required

### Step 1: Fix vite.config.ts
Open `vite.config.ts` and remove this line at the bottom:
```
ls -la ~/workspace
```

The file should end with just:
```typescript
  },
});
```

### Step 2: Clear Git Lock (if needed)
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix vite config syntax error and deploy"
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Use Existing Build
The previous build artifacts are still available in `dist/public`. If you can't fix the config file immediately, you can manually deploy these files:

1. Copy contents of `dist/public/` to your repository root
2. Commit and push those files directly
3. GitHub Pages will serve them immediately

## Current Status
‚úÖ Mock data fallback implemented
‚úÖ CNAME redirect disabled  
‚úÖ SPA routing configured
‚ùå Build process needs vite.config.ts fix

## What Works
Your HireNET website will work perfectly once deployed with:
- All animations and interactions
- Job listings from mock data  
- Contact form functionality
- Responsive design
- Fast loading times
