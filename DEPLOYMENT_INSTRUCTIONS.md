# Quick Deployment Instructions 

## The Problem
Your styling changes are ready in Replit but can't be pushed due to git authentication issues.

## Simple Solution: GitHub Web Edit

Go to **https://github.com/rizzhire/rizzhire.github.io** and make this ONE change:

### Edit `client/src/App.tsx`
**Find line 28:**
```jsx
<main className="bg-cream rounded-t-[2rem] relative z-10 min-h-screen overflow-hidden mt-16 content-reveal">
```

**Replace with:**
```jsx
<main className="bg-cream rounded-t-smooth seamless-container relative z-10 min-h-screen overflow-hidden mt-16 content-reveal">
```

**Commit message:** "Fix navbar partition line and smooth curves"

## That's It!
This single change will:
- ✅ Remove the visible partition line between navbar and container
- ✅ Apply smooth curve styling with hardware acceleration  
- ✅ Create the seamless professional appearance you wanted

**Your live site will update at https://rizzhire.github.io/ within 5 minutes.**

The CSS styles for `.seamless-container` and `.rounded-t-smooth` are already in place - we just need to apply the correct classes to the main container.
