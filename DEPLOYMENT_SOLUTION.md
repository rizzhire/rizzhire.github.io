# ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
GitHub Actions is using cached builds instead of fresh ones with your new service icons.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. âœ… Updated GitHub Actions workflow to clear all caches
2. âœ… Force fresh build on every deployment  
3. âœ… Fixed file paths (removing client/public/ references)
4. âœ… Added build verification and timestamps

## NEW WORKFLOW WILL:
- Clear dist/ and node cache completely
- Build fresh from your current code with new icons
- Deploy the exact files with proper timestamps
- Show build verification in Actions logs

## NEXT STEPS:
1. Commit these workflow changes
2. Trigger GitHub Actions manually 
3. Within 5-10 minutes, https://rizzhire.github.io/ will show:
   - Users icon for Manpower Supply
   - TrendingUp icon for Management Consultancy  
   - UserCheck icon for Recruitment Services

The new workflow guarantees fresh builds every time!
