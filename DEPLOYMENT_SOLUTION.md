# Deploy Your Changes to Live Site

## Current Issue
Git authentication is blocked in Replit environment, preventing automatic push to GitHub.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Replit's Git Integration (Recommended)
1. In your Replit interface, look for the **Git** tab/panel
2. Click "Commit & Push" or similar option
3. Add commit message: "Fix navbar partition line and smooth border curves"
4. Push to main branch

### Option 2: Terminal Command (If you have local access)
```bash
# From your local computer terminal:
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Manual File Upload (Last resort)
Upload these 3 modified files via GitHub web interface:
- `client/src/components/layout/navbar.tsx`
- `client/src/App.tsx` 
- `client/src/index.css`

## What's Ready to Deploy
✅ Removed navbar border (no more partition line)
✅ Smooth curved container edges (no sharp points)
✅ Hardware-accelerated rendering for better performance
✅ All existing features preserved

## Expected Result
Once pushed, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your updated site to:
**https://rizzhire.github.io/**

The styling improvements will be live within 2-5 minutes of successful push.
