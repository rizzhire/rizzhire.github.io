Hereâ€™s a complete Replit prompt you can use to generate your animation. This uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with terminology and logic explained clearly so Replit can implement it precisely.

**ðŸ§  Prompt for Replit:**

> Build an interactive scroll-based animation in a webpage. Here's how it should behave:
>
> ### Functionality:
>
> * **Three service cards**, placed one after another in the DOM.
> * **Scroll-triggered stacking animation**:
>
>   1. **Default view**: Only the **first card** is visible and centered.
>   2. When the user **scrolls down**, the scroll should be **locked temporarily** (using something like `overflow: hidden` or a full-screen section), and only the **second card animates in**, stacking **above** the first one with a smooth **translateY** or **scale** effect.
>   3. On further scroll, the **third card** appears and stacks above both previous cards.
>   4. After all 3 cards are stacked, the scroll should resume **normal page scroll behavior**.
>
> ### Reverse Behavior:
>
> * On **scrolling upward**, the cards should unstack in **reverse** order with reverse animation.
>
> ### Visual Logic / Effects:
>
> * Use **CSS transforms** (e.g. `translateY`, `scale`, or `z-index`) for stacking.
> * Use **`position: fixed`** or **`sticky`** to control the stacking region.
> * Use **JavaScript** to **detect scroll direction** and **which card is currently visible**.
> * Use **GSAP ScrollTrigger** or plain **IntersectionObserver + scroll listeners** for precision control.
>
> ### Technologies:
>
> * HTML for structure
> * CSS (Flexbox + Transforms + Animations)
> * JavaScript for scroll control
>
> ### Optional:
>
> * Make cards semi-transparent as they layer up for a beautiful effect.
> * Smooth animation duration (300msâ€“500ms).
>
> ### Output:
>
> Provide a full working example in Replit with:
>
> * `index.html`
> * `style.css`
> * `script.js`
>
> Make sure it's mobile responsive.

Let me know if you want this in a working code template right here instead of Replit.
