Industries We Serve – Redesign
Heading: "Industries We Serve"

Add detailed subsections covering relevant job markets & corporate sectors in the Middle East.

Suggested industries: Oil & Gas, Construction, IT & Technology, Healthcare, Hospitality, Education.

Layout:

Use CSS Grid (3 columns desktop, 2 columns tablet, 1 column mobile).

Each industry block: Image banner (object-fit: cover, border-radius: 8px), title, 3–4 bullet points highlighting sector demands & hiring trends.

Imagery:

Use optimized WebP images (under 200KB) with corporate styling filters (desaturated, slight gradient overlay).

Ensure alt attributes for accessibility.

3. Blog Section – Middle East Job Markets
Add 4–5 blog cards dynamically under a "Latest Insights" section.

Each blog post should have:

Title (H4)

Short description (max 30 words)

Author name (fictional, corporate-style like Sarah Khan – Senior Recruitment Analyst)

Profile avatar (circular, 60px, placeholder from https://ui-avatars.com)

Publish date

Read more link (dummy)

Layout:

Use Masonry or Card Grid style.

Responsive typography (clamp(1rem, 2vw, 1.2rem)).

4. Animation & Interaction
Use Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth corporate animations:

Fade-in + slight upward translate on scroll into view (opacity: 0 → 1, transform: translateY(30px) → 0).

Button hover: subtle background color shift and scale-up by 1.03.

Animations should be ease-out cubic-bezier(.25, .1, .25, 1) and under 0.5s duration.

Avoid parallax overload—keep motion minimal for professional feel.

5. Mobile Optimization
Audit and fix layout issues:

Ensure all homepage and service page sections use CSS Grid/Flexbox wrap for responsive stacking.

Optimize typography using fluid typography with clamp().

Minimize vertical padding so key visuals appear above the fold.

Ensure tap targets follow 44px × 44px guideline.

Compress images for faster load (use srcset and sizes for responsive images).

6. General Improvements
Use semantic HTML5 (section, article, header, footer, nav).

Follow BEM CSS naming convention for maintainable styling.

Apply consistent spacing system (8px grid system).
