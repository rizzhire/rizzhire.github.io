# Manual GitHub Pages Deployment Steps

## Current Status
All deployment files are ready and properly configured. The git lock issue requires manual intervention.

## Steps to Complete Deployment

### 1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
Navigate to your project directory

### 2. Clear Git Locks
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
rm -f .git/refs/heads/main.lock  
rm -f .git/refs/remotes/origin/main.lock
```

### 3. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### 4. Add All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### 5. Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment with proper asset paths and SPA routing"
```

### 6. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Direct File Upload
If git continues to have issues, you can manually upload these files via GitHub web interface:

### Required Files in Root Directory:
- `index.html` (✅ Ready - with relative asset paths)
- `404.html` (✅ Ready - with SPA redirect script)  
- `_redirects` (✅ Ready - fallback routing)
- `assets/` folder (✅ Ready - CSS and JS files)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (✅ Ready - updated workflow)

## What Happens After Deployment
1. GitHub Actions builds your React app
2. Static files are deployed to GitHub Pages
3. Site becomes available at: `https://rizzhire.github.io/`
