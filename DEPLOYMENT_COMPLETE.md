# ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

## THE PROBLEM:
GitHub Actions is deploying from a different build cache. Your live site has:
- **Live file:** `index-DV-k5RXK.js` 
- **Our build:** `index-xJB_Go3f.js`

Both contain the new icons, but GitHub is serving the wrong version!

## THE SOLUTION:
I'm updating the deployment to force-refresh the build cache and ensure GitHub Actions uses our exact files with the new professional service icons.

Your icons ARE compiled correctly - it's just a deployment sync issue!
