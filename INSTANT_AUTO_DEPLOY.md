# 🚀 Instant Auto-Deploy System - Ready!

## Status: ACTIVE ✅

Your auto-deployment system is now running in the background and monitoring your code changes.

## What Happens Now

### Immediate Action
Your current navbar partition and curve fixes will be deployed automatically within the next 10 seconds.

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Every time you save a file in the `client/` folder
- System waits 5 seconds for additional changes
- Automatically builds, commits, and pushes to GitHub
- Your live site updates at https://rizzhire.github.io/ within 2-5 minutes

## Current Background Process

The auto-deployment system is running and will:
1. Deploy your current navbar/curve fixes immediately
2. Watch for any future changes you make
3. Automatically push everything to GitHub Pages

## How to Check Progress

### Terminal Messages
Look for these messages in your console:
- "📝 Changed: filename" when files are modified
- "🚀 Auto-deploying changes..." when deployment starts
- "✅ Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages!" when complete

### GitHub Actions
Visit: https://github.com/rizzhire/rizzhire.github.io/actions
You'll see the deployment progress in real-time.

### Live Site
Check: https://rizzhire.github.io/
Changes appear within 2-5 minutes of deployment.

## Expected Results Soon

Within the next 5-10 minutes you should see:
- No more partition line between navbar and container
- Smooth curved borders (60px radius)
- Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Professional seamless appearance

The system is now fully automated - any changes you make will deploy automatically without any manual steps!
